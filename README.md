# Simulation study

This simulation study delves into the entire process of visiting the ”Za Lužánkami Swimming Pool”
throughout the day. This project is a part of the IMS course (Modelování a simulace) at VUT FIT
of “SHO Model služeb v oblasti sport“ topic.

The project involves model creation using multiple Petri nets and their implementation using C++
with a library Simlib.

Primary objective of this study is to compare the visitor’s experience before and after the pool’s
reconstruction and validate improvements made to enhance the lives of professional swimmers using
simulation model. The study investigates whether the following aspects have been positively
affected:
- Ease of training for professional swimmers.
- Reduction in distractions for professional swimmers caused by other people.
- Bandwidth of the pool after the increase in the number of booths and receptions.
- Changes in the peak number of people at the pool.


Furthermore, the study offers hypothetical insights into how to enhance the overall experience and
training efficiency for professional swimmers based on experiments with resulting model.
